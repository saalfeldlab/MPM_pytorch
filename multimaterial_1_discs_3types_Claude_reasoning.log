## Iteration 1 Complete

**Results:** R² = 0.474 (poor) - hidden_dim=64 was too small for 9000 particles

**Diagnosis:** The initial config had insufficient model capacity (hidden_dim=64) and potentially too high omega_f=80.

**Next iteration config:**
- **Mutation:** hidden_dim_nnr_f: 64 → 512 (8× increase)
- **Parent:** root (current node performed poorly)
- **Strategy:** exploit - increase capacity to address underfitting

The config file has been updated for iteration 2. The main change is increasing hidden_dim_nnr_f from 64 to 512, which should significantly improve the model's capacity to represent the Jp field for 9000 particles across 48 frames. The omega_f=80 remains unchanged for now to isolate the effect of hidden_dim.
